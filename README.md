# Randomizer Generator Lab

A minimal sandbox for authoring and testing text generators before promoting them to the main Randomizer project.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The dev server opens the minimal UI. Edit files under `generators/` and the page reloads.

See `LLM_Content_Development_Guide.md` for authoring guidelines and `system_design_doc.md` for engine design.
